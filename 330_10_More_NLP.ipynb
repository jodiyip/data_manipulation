it ever presents itself to my imagination as the\\nregion of beauty and delight.  there, margaret, the sun is for ever\\nvisible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a\\nperpetual splendour.  there—for with your leave, my sister, i will put\\nsome trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished;\\nand, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in\\nwonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable\\nglobe.  its productions and features may be without example, as the\\nphenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered\\nsolitudes.  what may not be expected in a country of eternal light?  i\\nmay there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may\\nregulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this\\nvoyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever.  i\\nshall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world\\nnever before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by\\nthe foot of man. these are my enticements, and they are sufficient to\\nconquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this\\nlaborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little\\nboat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his\\nnative river. but supposing all these conjectures to be false, you\\ncannot contest the inestimable benefit which i shall confer on all\\nmankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole\\nto those countries, to reach which at present so many months are\\nrequisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at\\nall possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.\\n\\nthese reflections have dispelled the agitation with which i began my\\nletter, and i feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me\\nto heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as\\na steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual\\neye.  this expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. i\\nhave read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have\\nbeen made in the prospect of arriving at the north pacific ocean\\nthrough the seas which surround the pole.  you may remember that a\\nhistory of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the\\nwhole of our good uncle thomas’ library.  my education was neglected,\\nyet i was passionately fond of reading.  these volumes were my study\\nday and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which\\ni had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction\\nhad forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.\\n\\nthese visions faded when i perused, for the first time, those poets\\nwhose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven.  i also\\nbecame a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;\\ni imagined that i also might obtain a niche in the temple where the\\nnames of homer and shakespeare are consecrated.  you are well\\nacquainted with my failure and how heavily i bore the disappointment.\\nbut just at that time i inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my\\nthoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.\\n\\nsix years have passed since i resolved on my present undertaking.  i\\ncan, even now, remember the hour from which i dedicated myself to this\\ngreat enterprise.  i commenced by inuring my body to hardship.  i\\naccompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the north sea;\\ni voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; i often\\nworked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my\\nnights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those\\nbranches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive\\nthe greatest practical advantage.  twice i actually hired myself as an\\nunder-mate in a greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. i\\nmust own i felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second\\ndignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest\\nearnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.\\n\\nand now, dear margaret, do i not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?\\nmy life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but i preferred glory to\\nevery enticement that wealth placed in my path. oh, that some encouraging\\nvoice would answer in the affirmative! my courage and my resolution is\\nfirm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. i am\\nabout to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which\\nwill demand all my fortitude: i am required not only to raise the spirits\\nof others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.\\n\\nthis is the most favourable period for travelling in russia.  they fly\\nquickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in\\nmy opinion, far more agreeable than that of an english stagecoach.  the\\ncold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which i have\\nalready adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the\\ndeck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise\\nprevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins.  i have no\\nambition to lose my life on the post-road between st. petersburgh and\\narchangel.\\n\\ni shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my\\nintention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the\\ninsurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as i think necessary\\namong those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. i do not intend to\\nsail until the month of june; and when shall i return? ah, dear sister, how\\ncan i answer this question? if i succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,\\nwill pass before you and i may meet. if i fail, you will see me again soon,\\nor never.\\n\\nfarewell, my dear, excellent margaret. heaven shower down blessings on you,\\nand save me, that i may again and again testify my gratitude for all your\\nlove and kindness.\\n\\nyour affectionate brother,\\n\\nr. walton'"
